I was so confuse but somehow listen to it and when I feel I understand something from this explanation, it makes me excited. A genius can make someone understand complicated things, I am very grateful.\n",
            "2. No fancy words, just simple English and the right pace to explain concepts. Brilliant.\n",
            "3. I've been trying to learn ML for quite awhile but could never really grasp the algorithim. She explains how the formula comes about and why is it used in the classification or regression so well. My god. Thumbs up for sensei Kylie and free code camp!!!\n",
            "4. I have no idea how my YouTube algorithm brought me here while I was sleeping but it made for some strange dreams\n",
            "5. For anyone getting an error related to converting a list to a float, the model.evaluate is actually returning a list.  She has the correction in the code at around 2:05:51, but she doesn't explicitly mention the correction.  You just grab the first value in the list (which is why she puts [0]).  So change the line where you obtain the val_loss to:                 \n",

            "8. This is my first Course which I've completed from FCC, got a good understanding on ML now, Thank you !!\n",
            "9. I think it is a very advanced video honestly. it should mention that you need a very solid foundation of statistics, coding, data science to even understand what is going on!!! its a medium level video\n",
            "10. I have to agree with those calling this tutorial too hard. I am a professional developer studying Cyber-Sec at the Master's level and found the first hour of the tutorial to be so intimidating that I had to go and learn Python again, just to boost my confidence. I followed it by getting a tutorial on Pandas as well as Numpy, those helped.\n",

            "I came back and realized that, while this is a really good tutorial, it isn't beginner-friendly at all. The kind of stuff Kylie accomplishes in a single line needs multiple lines from me and many more minutes to understand what's going on.\n",

            "12. If you're getting an error about comparing a list to a float.  Changing the \"least_val_loss\" variable to a list with two infinite floats will fix it.  Like this: least_val_loss = [float('inf'), float('inf')]\n",
            "13. Had to learn ML and had no idea where to start, how to start, though I had heard of certain terms and knew bits and pieces (and was confused). This has given me a good overview of the basics and the basic concepts and contents of ML are sort of organized in my mind now with the \"what is ML?\", \"what are the basic methods\" and most importantly, \"why the methods\" and \"How they work\" information clearly explained and examples of how to use the methods on python, so that it is now easy to take off from here - A relatively comprehensive yet brief overview - a need of the hour for me right now as I cannot afford to spend weeks or months learning everything, but needed a good overview for my tasks at hand. Searched many sources but this seems to be one of the best in clarity. Thank you!\n",
            "14. I recently completed the ML tutorial, and I wanted to express my gratitude for the outstanding content. The derivation and mathematical explanations were particularly impressive. I've been trying to grasp the fundamentals of machine learning for quite some time now, and this is the first tutorial where I genuinely understood the derivations and gained valuable knowledge about the topics plus the side by side implementation also helped alot. Thank you for creating such an informative and well-structured tutorial!\n",

            "17. This is basically Machine learning for everyone who is a Python programmer. But seems to be a nice video. Will get back to this after I finish Python\n",
            "18. This tutorial is quite challenging. As a professional developer, I found the first hour so intimidating that I had to revisit Python just to regain my confidence. After that, I went through tutorials on Pandas and Numpy, which helped a lot.  \n",
            "\n",
            "When I came back, I realized that while this is an excellent tutorial, it’s definitely not beginner-friendly. The way Kylie accomplishes complex tasks in a single line often takes me multiple lines and much more time to fully grasp.  \n",
            "\n",
            "For beginners, my advice is Take some time to learn Python fundamentals, along with Pandas and Numpy, before diving into this tutorial.\n",
            "19. I wonder how many of those millions of views are from the people who fell asleep and woke up to this\n",
            "20. YouTube somehow made me watch this video while I was sleeping and caused me to exceed my data plan\n",
            "21. You are literally the best, I've been looking for a tutorial for three days and yours works\n",
            "22. I just finished watching the entire video, taking a few days off to rest. Meanwhile, I also typed out all the code on Colab, mimicking what was shown. Overall, this video gave me a preliminary understanding of machine learning and opened the door to this unknown field for me. Of course, there is still a lot I need to learn, and many concepts are not very clear to me yet. However, with the prevalence of ChatGPT now, I can ask questions whenever I don't understand something. Compared to the previous technical environment, ChatGPT has made my learning process faster and more efficient. Finally, I would like to thank the blogger again. Perhaps, in the not-too-distant future, I might also make videos to guide others in getting started, haha.\n",
            "23. This is amazing. I'm a data analyst and had some formal training in machine learning, but my classes were really surface and \"teach yourself\" style. This is so much better. I also find it easier to listen to women, so that's a bonus lol\n",
            "24. Such a great video. I’m already 30min and learning a lot. My major is centered around AI and machine learning so I wanted a sneak peek at what’s to come. Thank you!\n",

I think that this course is not for absolute beginners despite the description, maybe if you've used libraries like Numpy and Pandas, but not for \"absolute beginners\". Nevertheless, she is an amazing tutor and this course is amazing for an overview. I suggest searching for a great visual of classification of ML and watch the course later on.\n",

It seems that nowadays the TensorFlow Model.evaluate returns both the loss and the accuracy in a list so at around 2:05 of the video the comparison val_loss < least_val_loss is no longer working.

            "60. Best video I've ever invested my time on!!!!! Thanks to Kylie!!! Looking forward for more from her\n",
            "61. It would be very beneficial for beginners to make Shallow, Deep and Convolutional Neural Networks from scratch. Because by doing so, they can learn many activations and their derivatives, forward propagation, and backward propagation. Along with, the dimensions of matrices and what is actually happening at each layer. Later on, they can shift to Tensorflow or Scikit when doing professional learning but I do advise to at least implement a neural network from scratch.\n",
            "62. you are very good at this thank you very much. I am very grateful. vey impressive i was able to understand something that I've always wanted to. thanks again\n",

            "70. Am I the only person who enjoys watching videos like this, without really understanding a single bit of it?\n",
            "71. hi im sorry i have a really stupid doubt related to the bayes theorem question... Please correct my logic: i thought that P(having disease) = P(True positive) + P(false negative). But acc to that, the ans to that question should be 0.1-0.01=0.09. which it isn't... Is this eqn wrong or can we not add probabilities like that or... Maybe im doing it all completely wrong. Pls help. Thank u so much\n",
            "72. to anyone who is starting i will suggest you should read this book -(Fundamentals of data science by Jugal K. Kalita,Swarup Roy,Dhruba K.)up to machine learning unit..and if any doubt do gpt,,it will definitely help yu to understand this wonderful course more effetively.\n",

            "103. lmaoo, thats why data sciencetist existed! their data mining skills are at their peak during their camp, so what they do is label, clean, balance the dataframe/dataset. ML engineers are responsible to fit that into our model, evaluate, and optimize to have better predictions. so that's why she doesn't really go into explanations on data because the main idea of this video is the ML Model\n",
