people that have copied people that have copied people that have copied
and then now we divide that by the total and then now we divide that by the total and then now we divide that by the total
number of people that have a positive number of people that have a positive number of people that have a positive

which is this section here which is this section here which is this section here
let's ignore this bottom part for now let's ignore this bottom part for now let's ignore this bottom part for now
so so so
base rule is asking okay what is the base rule is asking okay what is the base rule is asking okay what is the
probability of some event a happening probability of some event a happening probability of some event a happening
given that b happen so this given that b happen so this given that b happen so this
we already know has happened this is our we already know has happened this is our we already know has happened this is our
condition right well what if we don't have data for that well what if we don't have data for that
right like what if we don't know what right like what if we don't know what right like what if we don't know what
the probability of a given b is the probability of a given b is the probability of a given b is
well bayes rule is saying okay well you well bayes rule is saying okay well you well bayes rule is saying okay well you
can actually go and calculate it as long can actually go and calculate it as long can actually go and calculate it as long
as you have the probability of b given a as you have the probability of b given a as you have the probability of b given a
the probability of a and the probability the probability of a and the probability the probability of a and the probability
of b of b of b
okay and this is just a mathematical okay and this is just a mathematical okay and this is just a mathematical
formula for that formula for that formula for that
all right so here we have bayes rule all right so here we have bayes rule all right so here we have bayes rule
and let's actually see bayes rule in and let's actually see bayes rule in and let's actually see bayes rule in
action let's use it on an example action let's use it on an example action let's use it on an example
so here let's say that we have some so here let's say that we have some so here let's say that we have some
um disease statistics okay um disease statistics okay um disease statistics okay
so knock over different disease so knock over different disease so knock over different disease
and we know that the probability of and we know that the probability of and we know that the probability of
obtaining a false positive is 0.05 obtaining a false positive is 0.05 obtaining a false positive is 0.05
probability of obtaining a false probability of obtaining a false probability of obtaining a false
negative is 0.01 and the probability of negative is 0.01 and the probability of negative is 0.01 and the probability of
the disease is 0.1 the disease is 0.1 the disease is 0.1
okay what is the probability of the okay what is the probability of the okay what is the probability of the
disease given that disease given that disease given that
we got a positive test we got a positive test we got a positive test
how do we even go about solving this how do we even go about solving this how do we even go about solving this
so what what do i mean by false positive so what what do i mean by false positive so what what do i mean by false positive
what's a different way to rewrite that what's a different way to rewrite that what's a different way to rewrite that
a false positive is when you test a false positive is when you test a false positive is when you test
positive but you don't actually have the positive but you don't actually have the positive but you don't actually have the
disease so this here is a probability disease so this here is a probability disease so this here is a probability
that you'd have a positive test given that you'd have a positive test given that you'd have a positive test given
no disease no disease no disease
right right right
and similarly for the false negative and similarly for the false negative and similarly for the false negative
it's the probability that you test it's the probability that you test it's the probability that you test
negative given that you actually have negative given that you actually have negative given that you actually have
the disease so if i put that into a the disease so if i put that into a the disease so if i put that into a
chart chart chart
for example and this might be my positive and and this might be my positive and
negative tests and this might be negative tests and this might be negative tests and this might be
my diseases my diseases my diseases
disease and no disease disease and no disease disease and no disease
well the probability that i test well the probability that i test well the probability that i test
positive but actually have no disease positive but actually have no disease positive but actually have no disease
okay that's 0.05 over here okay that's 0.05 over here okay that's 0.05 over here
and then the false negative is up here and then the false negative is up here and then the false negative is up here
for 0.01 so i'm testing negative but i for 0.01 so i'm testing negative but i for 0.01 so i'm testing negative but i
don't actually have the disease this so the probability that you test this so the probability that you test
positive and you don't have the disease positive and you don't have the disease positive and you don't have the disease
plus the probability that you test plus the probability that you test plus the probability that you test
negative given that you don't have the negative given that you don't have the negative given that you don't have the
disease disease disease
that should sum up to one that should sum up to one that should sum up to one
okay because if you don't have the okay because if you don't have the okay because if you don't have the
disease then you should have some disease then you should have some disease then you should have some
probability that you're testing positive probability that you're testing positive probability that you're testing positive
and some probably that you're testing and some probably that you're testing and some probably that you're testing
negative but that probability negative but that probability negative but that probability
in total should be one in total should be one in total should be one
so that means that so that means that so that means that
the probability of negative and no the probability of negative and no the probability of negative and no
disease this should be the reciprocal disease this should be the reciprocal disease this should be the reciprocal
this would be the opposite so it should this would be the opposite so it should this would be the opposite so it should
be be be
0.95 because it's 1 minus whatever this 0.95 because it's 1 minus whatever this 0.95 because it's 1 minus whatever this
probability is probability is probability is
and then similarly and then similarly and then similarly
oops up here this should be 0.99 because up here this should be 0.99 because
the probability that we the probability that we the probability that we
you know test negative and have the you know test negative and have the you know test negative and have the
disease plus the probability that we disease plus the probability that we disease plus the probability that we
test positive and have the disease test positive and have the disease test positive and have the disease
should equal one should equal one should equal one
so this is our probability chart and now so this is our probability chart and now so this is our probability chart and now
this probability of disease this probability of disease this probability of disease
being point zero point one just means i being point zero point one just means i being point zero point one just means i
have a ten percent probability of have a ten percent probability of have a ten percent probability of
actually of having the disease right actually of having the disease right actually of having the disease right
like like like
in the general population the in the general population the in the general population the
probability that i have the disease is probability that i have the disease is probability that i have the disease is
0.1 0.1 0.1
okay so what is the probability that i okay so what is the probability that i okay so what is the probability that i
have the disease given that i got a have the disease given that i got a have the disease given that i got a
positive i got a positive positive i got a positive positive i got a positive
test well remember that we can write test well remember that we can write test well remember that we can write
this out in terms of bayes rule right so this out in terms of bayes rule right so this out in terms of bayes rule right so
if i use this rule up here if i use this rule up here if i use this rule up here
this is the probability of a positive this is the probability of a positive this is the probability of a positive
test given that i have the disease test given that i have the disease test given that i have the disease
times the probability times the probability times the probability
of the disease of the disease of the disease
divided by the probability of the divided by the probability of the divided by the probability of the
evidence which is my positive test evidence which is my positive test evidence which is my positive test
all right now let's plug in some numbers all right now let's plug in some numbers all right now let's plug in some numbers
for that the probability of having a for that the probability of having a for that the probability of having a
positive test given that i have disease positive test given that i have disease positive test given that i have disease
is is is
0.99 0.99 0.99
and then the probability that i have the and then the probability that i have the and then the probability that i have the
disease disease disease
is this value over here is this value over here is this value over here
0.1 okay okay
and then and then and then
the probability that i have a positive the probability that i have a positive the probability that i have a positive
test at all test at all test at all
should be okay what is the probability should be okay what is the probability should be okay what is the probability
that i have a positive test given that i that i have a positive test given that i that i have a positive test given that i
actually have the disease actually have the disease actually have the disease
and then having having the disease and then having having the disease and then having having the disease
and then the other case and then the other case and then the other case
where the probability of me having a where the probability of me having a where the probability of me having a
negative test given or sorry positive negative test given or sorry positive negative test given or sorry positive
test giving no disease times the probability of not actually times the probability of not actually
having a disease having a disease having a disease
okay so i can expand that okay so i can expand that okay so i can expand that
probability of having positive tests out probability of having positive tests out probability of having positive tests out
into these two different cases into these two different cases into these two different cases
i have a disease and then i don't i have a disease and then i don't i have a disease and then i don't
and then and then and then
what's the probability of having what's the probability of having what's the probability of having
positive tests in either one of those positive tests in either one of those positive tests in either one of those
cases cases cases
so that expression would become so that expression would become so that expression would become
0.99 0.99 0.99
times 0.1 times 0.1 times 0.1
plus plus plus
0.05 so that's the probability that i'm 0.05 so that's the probability that i'm 0.05 so that's the probability that i'm
testing positive but don't have the testing positive but don't have the testing positive but don't have the
disease disease disease
and the times the probability that i and the times the probability that i and the times the probability that i
don't actually have the disease so don't actually have the disease so don't actually have the disease so
that's 1 minus 0.1 the probability that that's 1 minus 0.1 the probability that that's 1 minus 0.1 the probability that
the population doesn't have the disease the population doesn't have the disease the population doesn't have the disease
is 90 is 90 is 90
so so so
0.9 and let's do that multiplication 0.9 and let's do that multiplication 0.9 and let's do that multiplication
and i get an answer and i get an answer and i get an answer
of 0.6875 or or
68.75 percent all right so we can actually expand that all right so we can actually expand that
we can expand bayes rule we can expand bayes rule we can expand bayes rule

evidence okay okay
so what is this fancy symbol over here so what is this fancy symbol over here so what is this fancy symbol over here
this means proportional this means proportional this means proportional
to to to
so how our equal sign means it's equal so how our equal sign means it's equal so how our equal sign means it's equal
to this like little squiggly sign means to this like little squiggly sign means to this like little squiggly sign means
that this is proportional to that this is proportional to that this is proportional to
okay okay okay
and this denominator over here and this denominator over here and this denominator over here
you might notice that it has no impact you might notice that it has no impact you might notice that it has no impact
on the class like this that number on the class like this that number on the class like this that number
doesn't depend on the class right so doesn't depend on the class right so doesn't depend on the class right so
this is going to be constant for all of this is going to be constant for all of this is going to be constant for all of
our different classes our different classes our different classes
so what i'm going to do is make things so what i'm going to do is make things so what i'm going to do is make things
simpler so i'm just going to say that simpler so i'm just going to say that simpler so i'm just going to say that
this probability this probability this probability
x1 x2 all the way to xn x1 x2 all the way to xn x1 x2 all the way to xn
this is going to be proportional to the this is going to be proportional to the this is going to be proportional to the
numerator i don't care about the numerator i don't care about the numerator i don't care about the
denominator because it's the same for denominator because it's the same for denominator because it's the same for
every single class every single class every single class
so this is proportional to x1 x2 so this is proportional to x1 x2 so this is proportional to x1 x2
xn xn xn
given given given
class k times the probability of that class k times the probability of that class k times the probability of that
class class class
okay okay okay
all right all right all right
so in naive bayes the so in naive bayes the so in naive bayes the
point of it being naive point of it being naive point of it being naive
is that we're actually is that we're actually is that we're actually
this joint probability we're just this joint probability we're just this joint probability we're just
assuming that all of these different assuming that all of these different assuming that all of these different
things things things
are all independent so in my soccer are all independent so in my soccer are all independent so in my soccer
example example example
you know you know you know
the probability that we're playing the probability that we're playing the probability that we're playing
soccer soccer soccer
um um um
or the probability that you know it's or the probability that you know it's or the probability that you know it's
windy and it's rainy and and it's windy and it's rainy and and it's windy and it's rainy and and it's
wednesday all these things are wednesday all these things are wednesday all these things are
independent we're assuming that they're independent we're assuming that they're independent we're assuming that they're
independent independent independent
so that means that i can actually write so that means that i can actually write so that means that i can actually write
this part of the equation here this part of the equation here this part of the equation here
as as as
this so each term in here this so each term in here this so each term in here
i can just multiply i can just multiply i can just multiply
all them together so the probability of all them together so the probability of all them together so the probability of
the first the first the first
feature given that it's class k feature given that it's class k feature given that it's class k
times the probability times the probability times the probability
of the second feature given that's of the second feature given that's of the second feature given that's

of of of
given that it's class k given that it's class k given that it's class k
so this expands to all of this so this expands to all of this so this expands to all of this
all right which means that this here is all right which means that this here is all right which means that this here is
now proportional now proportional now proportional
to the thing that we just expanded to the thing that we just expanded to the thing that we just expanded
times this times this times this
so i'm going to write so i'm going to write so i'm going to write
that out so the probability that out so the probability that out so the probability
of that class of that class of that class
and i'm actually going to use this and i'm actually going to use this and i'm actually going to use this
symbol so what this means is it's a huge symbol so what this means is it's a huge symbol so what this means is it's a huge

for every single i we're just for every single i we're just for every single i we're just
multiplying multiplying multiplying
these probabilities together these probabilities together these probabilities together

we're playing soccer we're playing soccer we're playing soccer
okay okay okay
so how do we use this in order to make a so how do we use this in order to make a so how do we use this in order to make a
classification classification classification

because we want to take the arg max well because we want to take the arg max well because we want to take the arg max well
we want we want we want
so okay if i so okay if i so okay if i
write out this write out this write out this
again this means the probability of again this means the probability of again this means the probability of
being in some class c k given all of our being in some class c k given all of our being in some class c k given all of our
evidence well we're going to take the k well we're going to take the k
that maximizes that maximizes that maximizes
this expression on the right this expression on the right this expression on the right
that's what arc max means so if k is in that's what arc max means so if k is in that's what arc max means so if k is in
zero oops zero oops zero oops
one through one through one through
k so this is how many categories there k so this is how many categories there k so this is how many categories there
are we're going to go through each k are we're going to go through each k are we're going to go through each k
and we're going to solve and we're going to solve and we're going to solve
this expression over here and find the k this expression over here and find the k this expression over here and find the k
that makes that the largest that makes that the largest that makes that the largest
okay okay okay
and and and
remember that instead of writing this we remember that instead of writing this we remember that instead of writing this we
have now a formula thanks to bayes rule have now a formula thanks to bayes rule have now a formula thanks to bayes rule
for helping us for helping us for helping us
approximate that right and something approximate that right and something approximate that right and something
that maybe we can that maybe we can that maybe we can
we maybe we have like the evidence for we maybe we have like the evidence for we maybe we have like the evidence for
that we have the answers for that based that we have the answers for that based that we have the answers for that based
on our training set so this principle of going through each so this principle of going through each
of these and finding whatever class of these and finding whatever class of these and finding whatever class
whatever category maximizes whatever category maximizes whatever category maximizes
this expression on the right this is this expression on the right this is this expression on the right this is
something known as m something known as m something known as m
ap for short ap for short ap for short
or maximum a a
posteriori uh pick the hypothesis so pick the k uh pick the hypothesis so pick the k
that is the most probable so that we that is the most probable so that we that is the most probable so that we
minimize the probability of minimize the probability of minimize the probability of

exactly just like above i'm going to exactly just like above i'm going to exactly just like above i'm going to
make my prediction make my prediction make my prediction

and of course i'm going to run and of course i'm going to run and of course i'm going to run
the classification report again the classification report again the classification report again
so i'm actually just going to put these so i'm actually just going to put these so i'm actually just going to put these
in the same cell in the same cell in the same cell
but here we have the y the new y but here we have the y the new y but here we have the y the new y
prediction and then y test is still our prediction and then y test is still our prediction and then y test is still our

so if i run this so if i run this so if i run this
you'll see that you'll see that you'll see that
okay what's going on here we get worse okay what's going on here we get worse okay what's going on here we get worse

which you know is not not that great which you know is not not that great which you know is not not that great
okay so let's move on to logistic okay so let's move on to logistic okay so let's move on to logistic
regression regression regression
here i've drawn a plot i have y so this here i've drawn a plot i have y so this here i've drawn a plot i have y so this
is my label is my label is my label
on one axis and then this is maybe one on one axis and then this is maybe one on one axis and then this is maybe one

well well well
we see that we see that we see that
you know i have a few of one class type you know i have a few of one class type you know i have a few of one class type
down here down here down here
and we know it's one class type because and we know it's one class type because and we know it's one class type because
it's zero and then we have our other it's zero and then we have our other it's zero and then we have our other

okay okay okay
so many of you guys are familiar with so many of you guys are familiar with so many of you guys are familiar with
regression so let's start there regression so let's start there regression so let's start there
if i were to draw a regression line if i were to draw a regression line if i were to draw a regression line
through this through this through this
it might look something it might look something it might look something
like like like
like this right right
well this doesn't seem to be a very good well this doesn't seem to be a very good well this doesn't seem to be a very good

specific line to predict why specific line to predict why specific line to predict why
right right right
it's it's it's it's it's it's
iffy iffy iffy
okay okay okay
um for example we might say um for example we might say um for example we might say
okay well it seems like you know okay well it seems like you know okay well it seems like you know
everything from here downwards would be everything from here downwards would be everything from here downwards would be
one class type in here upwards would be one class type in here upwards would be one class type in here upwards would be

visually can tell okay like visually can tell okay like visually can tell okay like
that line doesn't make sense things are that line doesn't make sense things are that line doesn't make sense things are
not those dots are not along that line not those dots are not along that line not those dots are not along that line
and the reason is because we are doing and the reason is because we are doing and the reason is because we are doing
classification not regression classification not regression classification not regression
okay okay okay
well first of all let's start here we well first of all let's start here we well first of all let's start here we
know that this know that this know that this
model model model
if we just use this line it equals m x if we just use this line it equals m x if we just use this line it equals m x
so whatever this let's just say it's x so whatever this let's just say it's x so whatever this let's just say it's x
plus b which is the y intercept right plus b which is the y intercept right plus b which is the y intercept right
and m is the slope and m is the slope and m is the slope
but when we use a linear regression is but when we use a linear regression is but when we use a linear regression is
it actually y hat it actually y hat it actually y hat
no it's not right so when we're working no it's not right so when we're working no it's not right so when we're working
with linear regression what we're with linear regression what we're with linear regression what we're
actually estimating in our model actually estimating in our model actually estimating in our model

so here let's rewrite this so here let's rewrite this so here let's rewrite this
as p equals mx as p equals mx as p equals mx
plus b okay well mx plus b that can range okay well mx plus b that can range
you know from negative infinity to you know from negative infinity to you know from negative infinity to
infinity right for any for any value of infinity right for any for any value of infinity right for any for any value of
x it goes from negative infinity to x it goes from negative infinity to x it goes from negative infinity to
infinity infinity infinity
but probability we know probably one of but probability we know probably one of but probability we know probably one of
the rules of probability is that the rules of probability is that the rules of probability is that
probability has to stay between zero and probability has to stay between zero and probability has to stay between zero and
one one one
so how do we fix this so how do we fix this so how do we fix this
well maybe instead of well maybe instead of well maybe instead of
just setting the probability equal to just setting the probability equal to just setting the probability equal to
that we can set the odds that we can set the odds that we can set the odds
equal to this so by that i mean okay equal to this so by that i mean okay equal to this so by that i mean okay
let's do probability divided by 1 minus let's do probability divided by 1 minus let's do probability divided by 1 minus
the probability okay so now it becomes the probability okay so now it becomes the probability okay so now it becomes
this ratio this ratio this ratio
now this ratio is allowed to take on now this ratio is allowed to take on now this ratio is allowed to take on
infinite values infinite values infinite values
but there's still one issue here but there's still one issue here but there's still one issue here
let me move this over a bit let me move this over a bit let me move this over a bit
the one issue here is that the one issue here is that the one issue here is that
mx plus b that can still be negative mx plus b that can still be negative mx plus b that can still be negative
right like if you know i have a negative right like if you know i have a negative right like if you know i have a negative
slope if i have a negative b if i have slope if i have a negative b if i have slope if i have a negative b if i have
some negative x's in there i don't know some negative x's in there i don't know some negative x's in there i don't know
but that can be that's allowed to be but that can be that's allowed to be but that can be that's allowed to be
negative negative negative
so how do we fix that so how do we fix that so how do we fix that
we do that by actually taking the log we do that by actually taking the log we do that by actually taking the log
of the odds of the odds of the odds
okay so now i have the log of you know some so now i have the log of you know some
probability divided by 1 minus the probability divided by 1 minus the probability divided by 1 minus the
probability and now that is on a range probability and now that is on a range probability and now that is on a range
of negative infinity to infinity which of negative infinity to infinity which of negative infinity to infinity which
is good because the range of log should is good because the range of log should is good because the range of log should
be negative infinity to infinity be negative infinity to infinity be negative infinity to infinity
now how do i solve for p the probability now how do i solve for p the probability now how do i solve for p the probability
well the first thing i can do is take well the first thing i can do is take well the first thing i can do is take
you know you know you know
i can remove the log by taking the not i can remove the log by taking the not i can remove the log by taking the not
the um the um the um
e to the whatever is on both sides e to the whatever is on both sides e to the whatever is on both sides
so that gives me the probability so that gives me the probability so that gives me the probability
over the one minus the probability over the one minus the probability over the one minus the probability
is now equal to e to the m x plus b is now equal to e to the m x plus b is now equal to e to the m x plus b
okay okay okay
so let's multiply that out so the so let's multiply that out so the so let's multiply that out so the
probability is equal to probability is equal to probability is equal to
one minus probability e to the m x plus one minus probability e to the m x plus one minus probability e to the m x plus
b b b
so p is equal to e to the m x plus b so p is equal to e to the m x plus b so p is equal to e to the m x plus b
minus p minus p minus p
times e to the m x plus b times e to the m x plus b times e to the m x plus b
and now we have we can move like terms and now we have we can move like terms and now we have we can move like terms
to one side so if i do p to one side so if i do p to one side so if i do p
uh so basically i'm moving this over so uh so basically i'm moving this over so uh so basically i'm moving this over so
i'm adding p so now p one plus i'm adding p so now p one plus i'm adding p so now p one plus
e to the m x plus b e to the m x plus b e to the m x plus b
is equal to is equal to is equal to
e to the m x plus b and let me change e to the m x plus b and let me change e to the m x plus b and let me change
this parenthesis make it a little bigger this parenthesis make it a little bigger this parenthesis make it a little bigger
so now my probability can be e to the mx so now my probability can be e to the mx so now my probability can be e to the mx
plus b plus b plus b
divided by 1 plus e to the mx divided by 1 plus e to the mx divided by 1 plus e to the mx
plus b okay okay
well well well
let me just rewrite this really quickly let me just rewrite this really quickly let me just rewrite this really quickly
i want a numerator of one on top i want a numerator of one on top i want a numerator of one on top
okay so what i'm going to do is i'm okay so what i'm going to do is i'm okay so what i'm going to do is i'm
going to multiply going to multiply going to multiply
this by negative mx plus b this by negative mx plus b this by negative mx plus b
and then also the bottom by negative mx and then also the bottom by negative mx and then also the bottom by negative mx
plus b and i'm allowed to do that plus b and i'm allowed to do that plus b and i'm allowed to do that
because because because

and the validation split so what the validation split does if so what the validation split does if
it's down here somewhere it's down here somewhere it's down here somewhere
okay so yeah this validation split is okay so yeah this validation split is okay so yeah this validation split is
just the fraction the training data to just the fraction the training data to just the fraction the training data to
be used as validation data be used as validation data be used as validation data
so essentially every single epoch what's so essentially every single epoch what's so essentially every single epoch what's
going on is going on is going on is
uh tensorflow saying leave certain if if uh tensorflow saying leave certain if if uh tensorflow saying leave certain if if
this is 0.2 then leave 20 this is 0.2 then leave 20 this is 0.2 then leave 20
out and we're going to test how the out and we're going to test how the out and we're going to test how the
model performs on that 20 that we've model performs on that 20 that we've model performs on that 20 that we've
left out left out left out
okay so it's basically like our okay so it's basically like our okay so it's basically like our
validation data set but validation data set but validation data set but
um tensorflow does it on our training um tensorflow does it on our training um tensorflow does it on our training
data set during the training so we have data set during the training so we have data set during the training so we have
now a measure outside of just our now a measure outside of just our now a measure outside of just our
validation data set to see you know validation data set to see you know validation data set to see you know

so validation split i'm going to make so validation split i'm going to make so validation split i'm going to make
that 0.2 that 0.2 that 0.2
and we can run this so if i run that set verbose set verbose
equal to zero which means okay don't equal to zero which means okay don't equal to zero which means okay don't
print anything because printing print anything because printing print anything because printing
something for 100 epochs might get kind something for 100 epochs might get kind something for 100 epochs might get kind
of annoying of annoying of annoying
so i'm just gonna let it run so i'm just gonna let it run so i'm just gonna let it run
let it train and then we'll see what let it train and then we'll see what let it train and then we'll see what
happens cool so it finished training and now cool so it finished training and now
what i can do is because you know i've what i can do is because you know i've what i can do is because you know i've
already defined these two functions already defined these two functions already defined these two functions
i can go ahead and i can plot the loss i can go ahead and i can plot the loss i can go ahead and i can plot the loss
oops oops oops
plot loss of that history plot loss of that history plot loss of that history
and i can also plot the accuracy and i can also plot the accuracy and i can also plot the accuracy
throughout throughout throughout

so so so
this is a little bit ish what we're this is a little bit ish what we're this is a little bit ish what we're
looking for we definitely are looking looking for we definitely are looking looking for we definitely are looking
for a steadily decreasing loss for a steadily decreasing loss for a steadily decreasing loss
and an increasing accuracy so here we do and an increasing accuracy so here we do and an increasing accuracy so here we do
see that you know our validation see that you know our validation see that you know our validation
accuracy improves from accuracy improves from accuracy improves from
uh around point seven uh around point seven uh around point seven
seven or something all the way up to seven or something all the way up to seven or something all the way up to
somewhere around point maybe eight one somewhere around point maybe eight one somewhere around point maybe eight one
and our loss is decreasing so this is and our loss is decreasing so this is and our loss is decreasing so this is
good good good
it is expected that the validation loss it is expected that the validation loss it is expected that the validation loss
and accuracy is performing worse than um and accuracy is performing worse than um and accuracy is performing worse than um
the training loss or accuracy and that's the training loss or accuracy and that's the training loss or accuracy and that's
because our model is training on that because our model is training on that because our model is training on that
data so it's adapting to that data data so it's adapting to that data data so it's adapting to that data
whereas the validation stuff is you know whereas the validation stuff is you know whereas the validation stuff is you know
stuff that it hasn't seen yet so stuff that it hasn't seen yet so stuff that it hasn't seen yet so
